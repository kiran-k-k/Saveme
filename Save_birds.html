        <h1>Seven Simple Actions to Help Birds</h1>
      </div>
    <section>
        <h3>1. Make Windows Safer, Day and Night.</h3>
        <div style="text-align:center; padding-top: 20px;">

        <p>Efforts to mitigate bird fatalities caused by window collisions can extend beyond individual actions and transform into community initiatives. One innovative approach is to collaborate with local businesses or public institutions to launch a contest for creative "window mural" designs. These murals not only enhance aesthetic appeal but also serve the crucial function of breaking up reflections on glass, making windows safer for birds. Additionally, supporting legislation to incorporate bird-friendly features in new architectural designs could have a lasting impact. Another practical and impactful solution is to initiate a "lights-out" campaign in your city, encouraging buildings to turn off unnecessary lights during peak bird migration periods. Such collective measures not only protect avian populations but also foster a community spirit centered on sustainability and wildlife conservation.</p>

        <h3>2. Keep Cats Indoors</h3>

        <p>Recognizing the significant impact that cats have on bird populations, it is imperative to take measures that protect wildlife while also promoting the well-being of our feline friends. Keeping cats indoors or providing safe outdoor environments like “catios” (cat patios) not only safeguard birds but also enhance the health and longevity of cats, shielding them from potential disease and accidents. Additionally, training your cat to walk on a leash can provide a rich, supervised outdoor experience. To address the broader issue of feral cat colonies, it’s crucial to raise awareness about their detrimental effects on local wildlife and advocate for humane management solutions. Speak out about the importance of responsible pet ownership and the impacts of unowned cats, which, due to disease and hardship, often have a lifespan as short as two years and account for the majority of bird deaths attributed to feline predation. By fostering community awareness and action, balancing the needs of both cats and wildlife becomes an achievable goal.</p>

        <h3>3. Reduce Lawn, Plant Natives</h3>

        <p>Over the years, birds have faced a growing challenge: fewer safe places to rest during migration and raise their young. This issue has been exacerbated by the loss of over 10 million acres of land in the U.S. to development between 1982 and 1997. Lawns and paved areas, which now cover more than 40 million acres in the country, offer minimal food and shelter for birds and other wildlife. However, this vast expanse of lawn presents an opportunity to restore ecosystems. By replacing lawns with native plants, homeowners can create havens for wildlife. Native plants not only enhance the beauty of a yard, but they also provide essential food and shelter for birds. The nectar, seeds, berries, and insects that thrive in these environments sustain a wide range of species, helping to support local biodiversity while inviting birds back into our communities.</p>

        <h3>4. Avoid Pesticides</h3>
        <div style="text-align:center; padding-top: 20px;">

        <p class="date">12th December, 2018</p>
        <p>The widespread use of pesticides in the United States poses a significant threat to both birds and the insects they rely on for food. Each year, over 1 billion pounds of pesticides are applied, with neonicotinoids—commonly known as "neonics"—being the most widely used. These insecticides are deadly to birds, either through direct contact or by contaminating the seeds and prey they consume. Additionally, common weed killers like 2,4-D and glyphosate, used in products such as Roundup, can harm wildlife and have even been linked to cancer in humans. The reduction in insect populations due to pesticide use indirectly harms birds by depleting their food sources. To protect birds, wildlife, and your family's health, consider purchasing organic food, as nearly 70% of U.S. produce contains pesticides. Reducing pesticide use around your home and garden can make a difference. You can also take action by urging your U.S. Representatives to support the Saving America’s Pollinators Act (H.R. 1337), which would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to suspend the use of harmful neonics.</p>

        <h3>5. Drink Coffee That’s Good for Birds</h3>
        <div style="text-align:center; padding-top: 20px;">

        <p class="date">12th December, 2018</p>
        <p>The rise of sun-grown coffee poses a serious threat to wildlife habitats, as three-quarters of the world’s coffee farms cultivate their plants in direct sunlight. This practice often involves clearing forests that birds and other wildlife depend on for food and shelter, while also requiring the use of harmful pesticides and fertilizers. Shade-grown coffee, by contrast, preserves the forest canopy, providing a vital habitat for migratory birds during the winter. Despite these benefits, many consumers are unaware of the environmental damage caused by sun-grown coffee or are hesitant to pay more for sustainable options. Choosing shade-grown coffee is a win-win-win: it not only offers rich flavor, but it also supports coffee farmers economically and protects more than 42 species of North American migratory birds, including orioles, warblers, and thrushes. For a greater impact, seek out Bird Friendly coffee certified by the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, which ensures organic standards are met. You can also advocate for change by educating local coffee shops and grocery stores about the benefits of shade-grown coffee.</p>

        <h3>6. Protect Our Planet from Plastic</h3>
        <div style="text-align:center; padding-top: 20px;">

        <p class="date">12th December, 2018</p>
        <p>The global plastic crisis has resulted in an estimated 4,900 million metric tons of plastic accumulating in landfills and polluting ecosystems worldwide. This persistent waste poses a grave threat to wildlife, particularly in oceans where seabirds, whales, and turtles often mistake plastic for food or become fatally entangled in it. With plastic taking over 400 years to degrade and only 9% of it being recycled, the environmental impact is staggering. At least 80 species of seabirds have been found to ingest plastic, with cigarette lighters, toothbrushes, and other debris discovered in the stomachs of dead albatrosses. To combat this issue, individuals can reduce their plastic use by avoiding single-use items such as bags, bottles, wraps, and disposable utensils, and opting for reusable alternatives. When using disposable plastics, recycling is essential. On a broader scale, advocating for the banning of plastic bags, Styrofoam, and straws can help curb this crisis. Encouraging stores to offer incentives for reusable bags and urging restaurants to phase out single-use plastics are impactful steps toward reducing plastic pollution.</p>

        <h3>7. Watch Birds, Share What You See</h3>

        <p>The extinction of the Passenger Pigeon, once the world’s most abundant bird, serves as a stark reminder of how quickly a species can disappear when its decline goes unnoticed. Monitoring bird populations is crucial for their protection, but tracking the health of the planet's 10,000 bird species is a monumental task. Scientists rely on the help of hundreds of thousands of individuals to report bird sightings from backyards, neighborhoods, and natural habitats. Without this critical data, it’s impossible to know where and when birds are declining. By participating in citizen science projects like eBird, Project FeederWatch, the Christmas Bird Count, Breeding Bird Survey, or the International Shorebird Survey, you can enjoy observing birds while contributing valuable information to help scientists identify thriving bird populations and areas in need of conservation. For those new to eBird, there’s a free course available to guide you through using the project and its tools. You can take it a step further by organizing bird walks, engaging school groups, and submitting your counts to eBird, or by supporting organizations that coordinate these vital monitoring efforts.</p>
