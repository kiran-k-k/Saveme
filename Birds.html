            <h2>How to Raise Awareness About a Bird in Danger?</h2>
            <p>
                Raising awareness about a bird species in danger requires a strategic approach that combines education, advocacy, 
                and community engagement. The first step is to create informative content such as brochures, posters, and videos that 
                highlight the bird's unique characteristics, habitat, and the threats it faces. Social media platforms like Instagram, 
                Facebook, and Twitter can be powerful tools for spreading the message, especially when using dedicated hashtags and 
                engaging influencers or wildlife organizations.

          <h3>Support Bird Conservation Programs:</h3>
          <p>
              Almost every city has a captive breeding program in a zoo or aviary for birds that are endangered. You can support 
              this program by making a donation or by offering voluntary help to these organizations. Offering support to one of 
              these programs in your city is the best way in which you can help stop the extinction of birds.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Learn About Endangered Birds:</h3>
          <p>
            Atleast 10% of the total bird species in the world officially fall in the list of endangered species. Intervention 
            is the most important step to take when it comes to conserving wildlife. If you learn about this list of birds that 
            are extinct it would be easy for you to speak about them while educating someone about the birds.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Be Responsible:</h3>
          <p>
            A responsible birder will always put the safety of birds before their personal interest. From setting up a bird feeder 
            in your garden to keeping pets indoors, you must ensure that the space is safe for the birds to stop by and rest. Any 
            actions that may stress the birds should be avoided. Although natural evolution is something that is not in your hand 
            there are artificial hazards caused by us that can be avoided. Fishing line, balloons, litter, certain holiday decorations, 
            etc. are all dangerous for the birds and other wildlife. As a responsible birder, you can avoid using those and request 
            your family and friends to do the same.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Protect the Natural Bird Habitats in Your Area:</h3>
          <p>
            Birds will show up in areas where there is nature â€“ food, water, trees, etc. is what they want. They like to rest in 
            places where human interference in minimum. Setting up your garden or backyard to be bird-friendly is where you can begin 
            to show how much you care for birds. You can also promote planting of trees, cleaning up the rivers or beaches so they 
            look more appealing to the migrating birds.
            <br>
            If you too love birds and animals, then you will love interacting with our animals. You can invite us for animal parties 
            or an animal handling workshop where your guests, both children, and adults, would be able to see, learn, and interact with 
            the animals with the help of our presenters. We have a mobile zoo which comprises of friendly animals like turtles, rabbits,
            tarantulas, geckos, vinegaroon and more that will be perfect for an animal party. We can also come over to your school for an 
            animal school visit or arrange for an animal workshop with us where the children can learn about animals and have fun too.
